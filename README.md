<h1>Rock Papper Siccors</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This is a simple python project I performed during A-levels, which is a simple Rock Paper Sissors game. Players take turns selecting their choices (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) using numeric options. The program validates inputs and  determines the winner of each round, updates the scores, and clears the screen for a clean interface. The first player to reach 3 points wins the game.
